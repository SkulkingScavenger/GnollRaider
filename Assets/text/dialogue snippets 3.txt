hey, what tastes better than a cookie baked in a tree?
um, bacon?
...
yes...
but what I was going to say was a cookie baked in ONE MILLION TREES
well, not a cookie, exactly. more like a giant pile of charred elf-meat
but its the same basic principle


what did we ever do to you
you're asking the wrong question, pal. What you really want to know is how much loot we'll get if we pillage your village.
thats awful
If I had a gold coin for every care I gave, I'd be so broke I couldn't even buy a hobbit.

look, you elves like nature right?
well... yes?
well, gnolls are just like nature: were vicious, hairy, and honestly don't give a crap about what happens to you. I think we'll get along fine.
um
