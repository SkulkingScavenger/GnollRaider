hey, what tastes better than a cookie baked in a tree?
um, bacon?
...
yes...
but what I was going to say was a cookie baked in ONE MILLION TREES
well, not a cookie, exactly. more like a giant pile of charred elf-meat
but its the same basic principle


what did we ever do to you
you're asking the wrong question, pal. What you really want to know is how much loot we'll get if we pillage your village.
thats awful
If I had a gold coin for every care I gave, I'd be so broke I couldn't even buy a hobbit.

So, you're the ambassador from that one elf place right?
Yes, that's right. I've been sent to talk to you about the fortress you're building.
yeah, what about it?
could you maybe not build it in our jungle?
No, why do you ask?
Its just, some of our people are a little uncertain about living so close to your people.
look, you elves like nature right?
well... yes?
well, gnolls are just like nature: were vicious, hairy, and honestly don't give a crap about what happens to you. I think we'll get along fine.
um, actually we kind of like the parts of nature that eat grass and do photosythesis..
hm...
hmmmm...
Yeah, I don't think we can be allies anymore...
wait, you don't mean...
sorry elf, but we have a strict policy about herbivores.


OI! GNOLLS! 
ho boy, defensive formations everyone, massive butthurt incoming...
A'right laddie, ye ain't comin' nigh til ye've given account of ye'selves
What is it now, pint-size?
We turn our backs fer five bloody minutes, and what do ye do?
The whole hall burnt te the bloody ground! fields charred to ash!
And best of all, no gold to be found within a hundred miles!
What do you have to say for ye'selves?
hey, look, sorry about your fort or whatever, but we're in a hurry.
OH NO YE DON'T! GET BACK HERE! OI!
GNOOOOOOOOOOLS!!!
