# gnoll-raider
Gnoll Raider is a multiplayer cooperative stealth-based dungeon crawling game featuring procedurally generated dungeons and customizable characters. Play a carnivorous hyena creature and amass plunder with your friends!

Due to a horrific error in judgement on my part (deciding to use the abomination that is the game maker:studio engine), the project must currently be opened and compiled using yoyogames game maker IDE.  This can be found for free at https://www.yoyogames.com/get
