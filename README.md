# gnoll-raider

Gnoll Raider is a multiplayer cooperative stealth-based dungeon crawling game featuring procedurally generated dungeons and customizable characters. 

Take control of a fiendish, man-eating hyena creature on a quest to acquire unfathomable wealth through clandestine practices. Set in a fantastical world populated by a variety of magical monstrosities and nocturnal horrors, the game follows the twisted affairs of the Khurikash Clan as it tricks, cheats, and stabs its way to power over the other inhabitants of the Umara Plains.

Due to a horrific error in judgement on my part this project uses the Game Maker engine (version 8.1). I plan to begin porting over to an opensource engine after the beta release.
