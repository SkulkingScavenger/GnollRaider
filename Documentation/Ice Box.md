ICEBOX
Here are a bunch of leftover tasks that keep getting pushed back. I don't want to forget about them, but I don't want to imply that I even intend to work on them until more pressing needs have been dealt with.

 - 1. AI and Combat Tweaks
	 - change the way attacking works (pathing, timing etc.)
	 - make attacks change depending on things like is_airborne and is_jumping
	 - add graphical indicators to show when a unit is being damaged or knocked back
	 - add abilities that work
	 - Implement camp AI
	 - implement dynamic group creation
	 - create variant AI for wandering monsters and special enemies
