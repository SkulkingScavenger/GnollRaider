Multiplayer Refactor Notes

Dead Reckoning:
	play animation. move in straight line with momentum (set x,y on packet receipt)

The Three Phases
	Initial Request(Slave)
	Master Receives, processes and distributes request Request/ Initial Request(Master)
	Slaves Receive and process Request

Script Conventions
	protocol handling scripts use the name of the packet id Constant (i.e., mu_move)
	convenience functions (that initialize a request) should be prefixed remote_ (ie, remote_move)

move and step should be handled together in mu_update()

next_room
next_floor


Only Master should create NPCs directly so they can be registered properly
Slaves must contact master to verify all user input

How to handle User Cast Ability?
	pass a phase variable around
	call the ability again with the second phase variable on fire
	animation info should be shared in update()
	just use it to create the projectile, let the slave handle the rest client-side
