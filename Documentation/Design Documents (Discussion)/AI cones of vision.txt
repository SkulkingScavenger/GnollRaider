The Cone of Vision

Abstract:
	3 kinds of objects
		unobscured
		obscured and moving
		obscured and still
	2 degrees of detection
		detected
		identified
	4 attributes of cones
		range: physical limits of sight
		width: how wide the cone is
		motion_sensitive: whether the cone detects only moving objects (cannot identify)
		darkvision_rating: impact of darkness on physical limits of sight
	4 cones
		direct: 45 degrees, long range, low darkvision
		side: 90 degrees, mid range, low darkvision
		peripheral motion: motion only, 180 degrees, short range, mid darkvision
		false sight: motion only, 360 degrees, very short range, high darkvision

detected vs. identified
	it is possible to see something without being able to tell what it is.
	detection means there is some visual feedback about an object. what the AI does about it depends on context
	identification means that an object has been positively identified (at least in the mind of the AI)
	
	if an object is out of range or behind a solid obstacle, he cannot be detected
	if an object is far away, but still in range, and/or is behind partial cover

motion vs. still
	cones are either set to detect motion or light. 
	motion sensitive cones cannot identify objects, only detect them.
	!!! motion sensitive cones may distinguish between slow movement and sudden movement
	suspicions that arose from visual movement are marked as moving.
	

obscured vs. unobscured
	an object is obscured if it has partial cover, either partially behind a wall or behind an object that is not completely solid. 

light vs. dark
	every unit has a darkvision rating between 0.00 and 1.00 (0% and 100% respectively)
	which can be modified globally by dungeon settings
	currently we are treating illumination as boolean (no gradients)
	the length of the darkvision is equal to length*darkvision
	when checking visibility, either the light or dark values are used, for illuminated or unilluminated targets
	thats really all there is.
	
EXAMPLE
	given a darkvision rating of 0.5 an object that can be detected in full illumination at 1000 pixels can be detected in darkness at 500 pixels.
	
	bats and other echolocators have 1.00
	orcs and goblins have about 0.75
	cats (rakasha) have about 0.50
	humans have about 0.25
	loxodon have about 0.10
	
	NOTE: motion-sensitive peripheral cones perform relatively better in the dark (should not exceed normal detection range). they tend to have a darkvision about 1.5 times greater than normal cones
	false sight detection should have full darkvision
