Modular Room System

In the simplest case, we have 4 quadrants

Each Quadrant is loaded from a schematic, offset by its quadrant coordinates

Manage the partitions:
	Each room should come with four buffer zones, one on each side.
	When the rooms are loaded, the buffers that intersect should be removed
	This will lead to graphics problems if buffers are mismatched, so be really careful about this
	Ultimately, we will need to keep the edges of the modules consistent, at least enough 
	

Instead of loading things like doors and start locations directly, add them to a list
when generating,
	randomly pick one of the four start locations
	randomly select a north door from one of the northern rooms
	randomly select an east door from one of the eastern rooms
	etc.

Everything random is generated

Then the whole thing is compiled into a chamber
