Projectile Dilemma:

1. Eliminate straight trajectory weapons
	All weapons fire in an arc or curve. Those that always fire straight just shouldn't be able to fire down cliffs

2. Ranged Weapons can't fire down cliffs period/ Don't make cliffside fire a thing

3. Ranged Weapons in the form of toggleable aimed abilities

4. guess the target height


I like number 2. The benefit of letting people shoot down cliffs is not worth the trouble. Instead of adding a complicated system to handle overly complex terrain, simplify the terrain. If you make different terrain heights, don't make it high enough to make it a problem. represent higher levels as being higher floors. In particular, don't juxtapose high altitude regions next to low altitude regions.
