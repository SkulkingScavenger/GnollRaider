Fixing the Level Editor
Because we want to do it right this time.

What Do we Want out of this?

 - 1. We want simple Collisions: everything will be either solid, or not solid.
 - 2. We want the levels to be easy to make
 - 3. We want the levels to look good

Internally, we will represent walls as impassable squares

Three Layers:
	Movement Layer: solid/non-solid
	Vision Layer: block LoS/not block LoS
	height Layer: tells the game how high to draw objects that are located on top of this object

Movement Layer is used most often, so it will be simple. when exporting, export the list of pathing blocker objects to be generated. 

Because of Complications inherent in dealing with vision and height, lets just try to avoid using these too often. 

Role of Tiles: some walls are best represented by tiles. However, some objects will be represented by custom sprites, so not all cells will generate tiles.

Half-cells: because of the way the cells are set up, ie, on an isometric grid, there is no way to make a straight North-South Wall. instead, a zig-zag pattern is created. So far, this hasn't been a big problem. If we want to allow for straight walls, we need to consider either the possibility of half-tiles, or the use of rectangular pathing for moving objects (so that they encounter zigzag walls as if they were solid.)

For the time being, I'd rather use square pathing. now that we aren't using advanced collision checking, it doesn't make a big difference to me what kind of pathing the people use, and its probably more efficient anyway.
