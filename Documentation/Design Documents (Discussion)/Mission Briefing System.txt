Mission Briefing System

For the time being, we will use a placeholder, as a full mission briefing is about as graphically intensive as a cinematic. 
Essentially, The Mission Briefing is a graphic script that is displayed to the player, explaining what the next mission is about. Usually, there will be multiple missions, and these will be described to the player. 

The Player may (possibly) ask questions and/or participate in the discussion, though at this point its hard to say what effect this should have (possibly curry favor with a faction?)

This will function like a discussion with many participants
